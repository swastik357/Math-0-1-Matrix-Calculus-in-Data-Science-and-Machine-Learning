(1) Note that in slide 7.jpg in My_mathematical_notes, in case of QUADRATIC POLYNOMIAL, the TAYLOR EXPANSION OF SECOND DEGREE is EXACT APPROXIMATION of the function. 
Therefore in case of QUADRATIC POLYNOMIAL, NEWTON METHOD is GUARANTEED TO give solution IN ONE ITERATION because DERIVATIVE of QUADRATIC POLYNOMIAL and TAYLOR EXPANSION 
are same, so the point where that DERIVATIVE is zero is also same in both cases.

(2) Note that in slide 4.jpg in My_mathematical_notes, a correction is needed in the top half of the slide. Partial derivative of z_j with respect to x_i should be -1 
instead of 1 when i = j
